/// NDT7 provides a framework to measure the download and upload speed.
/// NDT7 is based on WebSocket and TLS, and takes advantage of TCP BBR, where this flavour of TCP is available.
/// NDT7 always uses a single TCP connection.
///
/// NDT7 answers the question of how fast you could pull/push data from your device to a typically-nearby, well-provisioned web server by means of commonly-used web technologies.
/// This is not necessarily a measurement of your last mile speed.
/// Rather it is a measurement of what performance is possible with your device,
/// your current internet connection (landline, Wi-Fi, 4G, etc.),
/// the characteristics of your ISP and possibly of other ISPs in the middle,
/// and the server being used.
/// The main metric measured by ndt7 is the goodput, i.e., the speed measured at application level,
/// without including the overheads of WebSockets, TLS, TCP/IP, and link layer headers.
/// But we also provide kernel-level information from TCP_INFO where available.
/// For all these reasons we say that ndt7 performs application-level measurements.
///
/// The next example shows the whole implementation to get the information from NDT7
/// with a default `NDT7Settings`.
/// Please, check the `NDT7Settings` to undestand the parameters to be able
/// to define for the tests like hostname, paths, etc.
