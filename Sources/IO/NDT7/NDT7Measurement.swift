/// The MinRTT, RTT, and RTTVar fields can be used to compute the statistics of the round-trip time.
/// The buildup of a large queue is unexpected when using BBR.
/// It generally indicates the presence of a bottleneck with a large buffer that's filling as the test proceeds.
/// The MinRTT can also be useful to verify we're using a reasonably nearby-server.
/// Also, an unreasonably small RTT when the link is 2G or 3G could indicate a performance enhancing proxy.
///
/// The times (BusyTime, RWndLimited, and SndBufLimited) are useful to understand where the bottleneck could be.
/// In general we would like to see that we've been busy for most of the test runtime.
/// If RWndLimited is large, then it means that the receiver does not have enough buffering to go faster and it is limiting our performance.
/// Likewise, when SndBufLimited is large, the sender's buffer is too small.
/// Also, if adding up these three times gives us less time than the duration of the test,
/// it generally means that the sender was not filling the send buffer fast enough for keeping TCP busy,
/// thus slowing us down.
///
/// The amount of BytesAcked combined with the ElapsedTime gives us the average speed at which we've been sending, measured in the kernel.
/// Because of the measurement unit used, by default the speed will be in bytes per microsecond.
/// Typically the speed of file transfers is measured instead in bytes per second, so you need to multiply by 10^6.
/// To obtain the speed in bits per second, which is the typical unit with which we measure the speed of links (e.g. Wi-Fi), also multiply by 8.
///
/// BytesReceived is just like BytesAcked, except that BytesAcked makes sense for the sender
/// (e.g. the server during the download), while BytesReceived makes sense for the receiver (e.g. the server during the upload).
///
/// BytesSent and BytesRetrans can be used to compute the percentage of bytes overall that have been retransmitted.
/// In turn, this is value approximates the packet loss rate, i.e. the (unknown) probability with which the network is likely to drop a packet.
/// This approximation is really bad because it assumes that the probability of dropping a packet is uniformly distributed,
/// which isn't likely the case. Yet, it may be an useful first order information to characterise a network as possibly very lossy.
/// Some packet loss is normal and healthy,
/// but too much packet loss is the sign of a network path with systemic problems.
